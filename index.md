Welcome to my page! I am Andrei, a mid-level data scientist who is passionate about applying cutting-edge machine learning and data engineering approaches to real-world problems.

I currently work as a data scientist at Lowe's Companies with Customer 360 team. I earned my BS and MS in Radio Physics from Kazan Federal University, Russia. I also completed a Graduate Certificate in Data Analytics program at Virginia Tech.

Outside of my career and academia, I am a huge soccer and tennis fan and cooking enthusiast. Feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn.
