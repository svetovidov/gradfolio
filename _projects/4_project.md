title: Oil Well Clustering
description: Kohonen net-based clustering approach
---

In this project, I implemented the Kohonen neural network mechanism to perform clustering in a scenario when the desired/optimal number of clusters is initially unknown. This method was applied to the data obtained from the oil wells located in the Volga region (Russia). Dividing wells into clusters in a meaningful way can help oilfield engineers to plan well treatment in an optimal way. The results were reduced in dimensionality with the t-SNE method and visualized.
